# Mukette: A Markdown Pager (WIP, but works!)


Mukette is a Markdown pager. It uses ncurses to format Makrodwn files in your terminal. There still remains truckload of things and features to be added (most importantly, link highlighting) but for the moment, you can build it.


```
sudo apt-get install ncurses
make
```

Then you can:

```
./mukette example-document.md
cat example-document.md | ./mukette
```


I may pause work on this for now, but if you have taken an interest in this project, do send me a PR.
