.SH NAME
mukette \- Parse Markdown and display using ncurses
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmukette\fR [\fIFILES...\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Mukette is a utility that parses Markdown-formatted text and displays it using ncurses. It provides a paginated view for comfortable reading, with Markdown elements formatted into Bold, Italic, etc. Mukette also handles Markdown tables. If a FILE is provided, Mukette reads content from that file; otherwise, it accepts input via STDIN.
.SH USAGE
You can pass a Markdown-laden buffer via STDIN or files via command-line arguments. If both are provided, both STDIN and arguments are used. No need to pass a '-' when using STDIN. In the page window, navigate between hyperlinks with TAB. Press Q, F1, or the default exit key to exit the pager.
